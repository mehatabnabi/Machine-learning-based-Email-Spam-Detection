## MACHINE LEARNING BASED SPAM EMAIL DETECTION

### Objective/Business Problem
Email has become one of the most important forms of communication. Below are some of the stats concerning emails:

* There are over 4 billion email users worldwide.
* There are over 7 billion email accounts.
* 95% of consumers check email every day.
* In 2020, over 306 billion emails were sent and received daily.
* Over 3 million emails are sent every second.
* Total email volume grew 7% in 2020.

In these collosal stats, Spam literally accounted for 47.3% of all email traffic in 2020. That means, about half of all the emails in the world are unsolicited messages. Data from 2020 points to the average percentage of 47.3%, meaning close to 150 billion spam emails are sent daily. Therefore, an effective spam filtering technology is a significant contribution to the sustainability of the cyberspace and to our society (Reference - https://99firms.com/blog/how-many-email-users-are-there/#gref)


The objective of this project is to build an efficient ML based email spam detector application. We are going to use 4 machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, Support vector machine classifier (SVM), Random forest, Gradient boosting classifier) to classify the dateset containing spam and ham emails into their respective labels.
